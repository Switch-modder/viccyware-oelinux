# EXPLANATION:
# Kitt-AI only provided hard-float-linking libraries for snowboy.
# So, the only way to use it in our softfp-linking OS is to statically
# compile it into a server program and have vic-anim comm with it over IPC.
# We are just copying in something made with a much newer gnueabihf toolchain.
